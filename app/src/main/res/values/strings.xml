    <string name="str_about">WeLearn is a project that aims to find ways for informing teachers and students in higher education to support neighbourness in their multicultural learning environments. We study neighbourness practices and create instructions for educators and students on how to embrace those practices to make the learning environments, digital and physical, better for all. The WeLearn project consortium consists of six European partners. Tampere University, Riga Technical University, Film University Babelsber, Aalborg University, Catholic University of Sacred Heart and Suleyman Demirel University. The WeLearn project is lead by Tampere University, while Riga Technical University is in charge of the technical development of the WeLearn mobile application. \n \nThe content of this application represents the views of the author only and is his/her sole responsibility.
